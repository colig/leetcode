/*
 * my best dev env
 * os: windows ?  
 *
 * good: 
 *  embedded softwares rely on windows 
 *  we can play windows hack 
 *  neovim is fine 
 *  bunch of IDEs but vscode is just fine 
 *  it's stable
 *
 * bad: 
 *  always don't known softwares do what
 *  cmd is trush - terminal.exe could fix this?
 *  dir not sensitive 
 *  (neovim no plugins but vscode is fine) 
 *  (sorts of projects need unix-like env, we can use vscode remote), this results:
 *  -- overhead
 *  -- inconsistence -> avoid use multi dev env or use remote->overhead
 *
 *  wsl is trash. we could avoid inconsistence and just use local) exists) 
 *  we will play game to waste my time
